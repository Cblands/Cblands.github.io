              My name is Conor Butte-Landsfried, a Software Engineering student at the University of Victoria. I am currently in my 4th year and have 
              an expected graduation date of August 2021. Academically, my main focus in school has been in machine learning and software security. More recently,
              I have begun to focus on scalable systems as well as robust and efficient computing. Professionally, I have had much experience working as a React 
              developer for frontend development, as well as backend python development.
              <br>
              <br>
              Outside of work and school, I like to balance my time between projects and physical activity. I am currently working on a
              <a style="color: #222;" href="https://github.com/sentalytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal project</a> focused on building 
              skills with industry technology such as AWS serverless architecture, noSQL databases and machine learning. Aside from software development, I also believe 
              it is equally important to physically exercise to stay healthy both physically and mentally. Over the past three years I have taken part in several half 
              marathons, most recently participating in the Victoria 70.8 Ironman race.

          <p class="section-body">
            Most recently, I was employed as a Full Stack Developer at 
            <a style="color: #222;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/varsity-tutors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varsity Tutors</a>, 
            a position which I held for 2 years. The first half of my
            employment was spent as an intern, working as a React Developer. The second half of my employment consisted of part-time contract work while attending 
            University, with a focus on backend Python development. As a full stack developer at Varsity Tutors, my main responsibilities consisted 
            of maintaining and developing a Python backend hosted on AWS and a React.js web application. These responsibilities allowed me to become familiar 
            with serverless architecture, microservices and an agile working environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            Prior to working at Varsity Tutors, I obtained an internship as an IT technician for the <a style="color: #222;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/department-of-national-defence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Defence</a>.
            This position was crucial in developing low level technical skills such as learning how to manage networks, operating system images and large scale
            equipment inventory. While in this position, I also gained familiarity with writing bash scripts and data management using python.

            <br>
            My first internship was as an instructor for <a style="color: #222;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/byte-camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Byte Camp</a>.
            This position consisted of teaching students the fundamentals of programming, ranging from simple games using scratch, to more advanced projects such as platform style 
            games written in javascript. While working at Byte Camp I developed many soft skills such as time management, conflict management and leadership.
